We have to calculate the sum of all the nodes in a binary tree. To get the sum of all nodes in binary tree, we need to traverse the whole binary tree and while traversing we can start adding the sum of each node.


As we know the Tree Traversal techniques, we can use any of them to traverse the binary tree. We can go through these techniques.

BFS (Breadth first Search or level order taversal)

DFS (Depth first search like pre order , post order and in order)


we will use BFS to iterate through the binary tree level by level.
